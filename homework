# lesson1
We learned about the history of Android and the tools we will use to develop Android applications and
how to install them on our windows machines. We alos learned how to connect an Android device to the Studio 
and use it for debugging our application.

We got to see a simple Demo appliction developed by the professor whic included a GUI 
and touch events and a simple count down timer with sounds playing in response to some events.
